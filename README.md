### What is Ggbot?
Ggbot is an discord bot, made with Discord.JS, with many different utilities to help make your server better.
It primarily is an economy bot, but also has moderation commands, utilty commands, and misc commands.

### Why should I use Ggbot over another bot?
Ggbot is a hypercustomizable bot, that lets you take control of everything. You can change command text, prefixes, commands, bot status, and nearly everything else about your bot. It's meant to be **your** bot, so you get the power.
